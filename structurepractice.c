/*Design a system for managing information about students, teachers, and staff within an educational institution. Create a C project that utilizes structures to store and manipulate data for each category. The system should allow the user to perform various functions such as adding new records, updating existing records, deleting records, and displaying information.

Requirements:

Implement separate structures for students, teachers, and staff, each containing relevant information such as name, age, address, contact details, etc.

Develop functions to perform the following operations:

Add a new student, teacher, or staff member to the system.
Update the information of an existing student, teacher, or staff member.
Delete a student, teacher, or staff member from the system.
Display the details of all students, teachers, or staff members.
Ensure that the system can handle a dynamic number of records for each category. Consider using dynamic memory allocation to achieve this flexibility.

Implement error handling mechanisms to address potential issues such as invalid input, memory allocation failures, etc.

Create a user-friendly interface with a menu system that allows the user to choose the desired operation.

Provide an option to save and load data to/from a file, allowing the system to retain information between different program runs.

Bonus: Implement additional features such as searching for a specific student, teacher, or staff member, sorting the records based on different criteria, etc*/
